# Text-Based Adventure Game
A text-based adventure game is designed with the following features:

# Rooms with Textual Descriptions:
Each room in the game is accompanied by a detailed textual description, allowing players to visualize their surroundings.

# Path between Rooms:
The game includes a network of paths that connect different rooms, enabling players to navigate through the game world.

# Player Inventory:
A player inventory system is implemented, allowing players to collect and store items they find during the game. The inventory serves as a repository for the player's possessions.

# Locked Door Mechanism:
The game incorporates locked doors that can be opened if the player possesses a specific key in their inventory. To progress through the game, players must locate and use the appropriate key to unlock the door.

# Door State:
Once a door is unlocked using the correct key, it remains open, granting unrestricted access to the connected room. The door remains in this state for the duration of the game.

When the player successfully unlocks a door using a key, the key is automatically removed from their inventory, ensuring it cannot be reused.

# Objective Completion Notification:
The game notifies the player when they have reached their objective, indicating successful completion of a particular task or the game itself.

# Movement Functions:
The game provides defined functions for player movement, allowing them to navigate between rooms and explore the game world.

In addition to traditional movement between rooms, the game features the ability to teleport, enabling players to quickly move to specific locations within the game world.
